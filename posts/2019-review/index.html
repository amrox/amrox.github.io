        <p>For the reboot of my blog, I thought I&rsquo;d do a quick recap some of my professional learnings of the last year.</p>
<h2 id="modern-c">Modern C++</h2>
<p>The last time I used C++ on the regular was 2007. Well, a lot has changed since then. C++0x became C++11, marking the beginning of the &ldquo;Modern C++&rdquo; era. I picked up a copy of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18197265-a-tour-of-c">A Tour of C++</a> to reacquaint myself with the language. I also subscribed to the <a href="https://cppcast.com/">CppCast</a> and <a href="https://cpp.chat/">cpp.chat</a> podcasts.</p>
<p>Why subject myself to C++ in a world with <em>true</em> modern languages like Rust and Swift? C++ and C are the only tried and true ways to create compact, performant, library-level code that can run on both iOS and Android. Rust and Kotlin-Native are promising but not there yet. I have <em>a lot</em> more thoughts on this topic. Stay tuned.</p>
<h2 id="cmake">CMake</h2>
<p>Most modern C++ projects use <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> as the build system. I had been exposed to CMake before, but I didn&rsquo;t really &ldquo;get&rdquo; it. I would just google and stackoverflow and swear my way through minor edits. This year, I decided I wanted to actually try to learn it. I came across a great interview with <a href="https://cppcast.com/craig-scott-cmake/">Craig Scott on CppCast</a> which led me to <a href="https://crascit.com/professional-cmake/">his book on CMake</a>. That, along with online guides such as <a href="https://gist.github.com/mbinna/c61dbb39bca0e4fb7d1f73b0d66a4fd1">Effective Modern CMake</a> has been immensely helpful.</p>
<h2 id="flutter">Flutter</h2>
<p><a href="https://flutter.dev">Flutter</a> is a cross-platform mobile (and web <em>and</em> desktop) framework from Google. We used it to develop some sales tools at work. My experience was&hellip; mixed.</p>
<p>Full disclosure, I have not written a line of Dart myself yet. Rather, I was responsible for a team that was writing Dart and the CI/CD pipeline for the project. I was hoping to see much faster iteration than we experienced with separate native iOS and Android codebases. This didn&rsquo;t really pan out, but I&rsquo;m not sure we gave it a fair shot either.</p>
<p>First, we integrated Flutter into existing iOS and Android projects, instead of letting Flutter &ldquo;own&rdquo; the project. This broke a lot of the advantages of Flutter, like hot-code reloading. Kind of the worst of both worlds. Also we had to integrate heavily with our own native framework, which is a often a weak point of cross-platform tools.</p>
<p>However, I hope to learn to try Flutter again in a more standard way. Hopefully my experience will be better.</p>
<h2 id="modern-javascript--react">Modern JavaScript &amp; React</h2>
<p>I never cared much for JavaScript (I&rsquo;m looking at you, <code>var</code>). However, <a href="http://es6-features.org/#Constants">ECMAScript 6</a> (aka EMCMAScript 2015, aka ES6) has fixed that with the addition of <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>, among many other things. Also, JS is pretty hard to ignore these days. So, I bit the bullet and jumped into the wild world of modern frontend web development. And actually, it&rsquo;s not that bad! The frameworks and tooling have come quite a long way. I&rsquo;m working my way through <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/">Modern JavaScript From The Beginning</a> on Udemy and enjoying it.</p>
<p>For frameworks, <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> seems like it&rsquo;s <a href="https://2019.stateofjs.com/front-end-frameworks/">here to stay</a>. I&rsquo;ve been using it a bit at work and it&rsquo;s productive and enjoyable so far. I&rsquo;m also curious <a href="https://react-native.org/">React Native</a>, but mostly as a opportunity to play with <a href="https://cljsrn.org/">ClojureScript</a>.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p>These are the tech, management and leadership books I added to by brain last year. I didn&rsquo;t necessarily read them all cover to cover â€“ most of them are not that kind of book.</p>

<p>They say always say that starting is the hardest part. I&rsquo;m happy to be writing again and I hope to have a lot more to share with you in the year to come.</p>
